# AI-agent shopping assistant

## Overview
This is a shopping assistant built with LangGraph and LangChain. The underlying idea is to build a ReAct agent with RAG functionality. It can answer questions about the products and the company and give product recommendations. I use [Shokz Canada](https://ca.shokz.com/) store as an example to build the agent.

```

### Setting up env variables
Create a `.env` file under the `studio` directory with the following:

### Set ANTHROPIC API key
*  Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your `.env` file 

### Sign up and Set LangSmith API

*  Set `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true` in your environment 

### Set up LangGraph Studio

* Currently, Studio only has macOS support and needs Docker Desktop running.
* Download the latest `.dmg` file [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio?tab=readme-ov-file#download)
